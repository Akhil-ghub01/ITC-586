## 4. Return Shipping Costs

- If the return is due to **our error** (e.g., wrong item shipped, defective product):

## 5. Condition of Returned Items

- Returned items are inspected upon arrival.
- If the item:
  - Is in **resellable condition** (unused, undamaged, original packaging):
    - A full refund is generally issued.
  - Shows **signs of use or damage** not caused by shipping:
    - A partial refund or rejection of the return may apply, depending on severity.

If a return is rejected:

- The customer is informed with:
  - Clear explanation of the reason.
  - Options, if any (e.g., sending the item back at customer’s cost).

## 6. Refund Methods and Timing

- Refunds are issued to the **original payment method** whenever possible.
- If this is not possible (e.g., expired card), store credit may be offered instead.
- Once the return is received and approved:
  - Refunds are processed within **5–10 business days**.
- It may take additional time for the customer’s bank or card issuer to post the refund.

Agents should remind customers:

> “Once we process the refund, your bank or card issuer may take additional days to display the refund on your statement.”

## 7. Exchanges

- If the customer wants a different size, color, or variant:
  - Option 1: Standard return + new purchase
  - Option 2: Direct exchange (if supported by our systems and stock levels)
- For direct exchange:
  - We ship the replacement item once the original item is scanned by the carrier or received at our warehouse.

## 8. Defective, Wrong, or Incomplete Items

If the customer receives:

Steps:

2. Ask for:

   - Photos of the item/packaging (for defects or wrong items)
3. Offer one of the following:
   - Replacement of affected items (at no extra cost), or
   - Full refund for missing or defective items.

Agents should confirm which option the customer prefers, when possible.

## 9. Refunds for Orders Not Yet Shipped

- If the order has **not yet shipped**, and the customer cancels:
  - We issue a full refund to the original payment method.
- If the order has already shipped:
  - The customer may need to follow the normal return process instead.

## 10. Store Credit and Gift Returns

- If the customer returns an item that was received as a **gift**:
  - We may offer store credit instead of refunding the original payer.
- Store credit can be used on future purchases and usually does not expire (unless specified by policy).
