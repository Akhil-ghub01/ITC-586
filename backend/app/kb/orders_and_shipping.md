- If the customer wants to change or cancel an order:
  - They should contact support as soon as possible with:

## 7. Delayed Orders

An order is considered **delayed** if:

- It has not arrived **3 days after the maximum estimated delivery date** for the chosen shipping method, **and**
- The tracking information is not updating or shows an unexplained delay.

In case of a confirmed delay:

- Support should:
  - Verify tracking information with the carrier.
  - Provide the customer with an updated delivery estimate where possible.
- As a goodwill gesture (if allowed by policy), we may:
  - Offer a **discount on a future order**, or
  - Offer **free express shipping on the customer’s next order**.

## 8. Lost or Missing Packages

A package may be considered lost if:

- Tracking shows “delivered” but the customer did not receive it, **or**
- No tracking updates for more than **7 business days**.

Steps:

1. Ask the customer to:
   - Confirm the shipping address.
   - Check with neighbors, building reception, or family members.
2. If still not found:
   - Open an investigation with the shipping carrier.
3. Once confirmed lost:
   - We may either:
     - Resend the items at no extra cost (if stock is available), **or**
     - Provide a full refund.
