# Account and Security

This article explains how customer accounts work and how we protect their information.

---

## 1. Creating an Account

- Customers can create an account using:
  - Email address and password, or
  - Supported social login options (if available).
- To complete registration, the customer must:
  - Provide a valid email address.
  - Agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

Benefits of having an account include:

- Faster checkout
- Order history and tracking
- Saved addresses and preferences

## 2. Logging In and Password Management

### 2.1 Logging In

- Customers log in using:
  - Their registered email address
  - Their password (or social login if enabled)

### 2.2 Forgot Password

If a customer forgets their password:

1. They click **“Forgot password?”** on the login page.
2. They enter their registered email address.
3. A password reset link is sent to that email.
4. The link is time-limited for security reasons.
5. The customer can set a new password using this link.

Agents should never ask for or share a customer’s password.

## 3. Two-Factor Authentication (If Enabled)

- Where available, customers can enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** or similar security features in their account settings.
- 2FA typically requires:
  - Something they know (password) and
  - Something they have (code delivered via email/app/SMS, depending on implementation).
- If the customer loses access to their 2FA method, they may need to go through an identity verification process.

## 4. Managing Personal Information

From the **My Account** area, customers can:

- Update their name and contact details.
- Add, edit, or remove shipping addresses.
- Add or update saved payment methods (if supported).
- View order history and order details.

Some fields may be restricted from editing if required by security or legal reasons.

## 5. Payment Information and Security

- We do **not** store full card numbers in plain text.
- Payment processing is handled through secure, PCI-compliant payment providers.
- Sensitive data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS.
- For saved payment methods, we typically store only:
  - A token provided by the payment gateway (not the full card number)
  - The last 4 digits of the card and expiry date (for display purposes only)

Agents should reassure customers that:

> “We never see or store your full card number in plain text. All payments are handled via secure, industry-standard payment gateways.”

## 6. Account Security and Suspicious Activity

### 6.1 Security Recommendations for Customers

We recommend that customers:

- Choose a strong, unique password for their account.
- Do not reuse passwords from other websites.
- Do not share their login details with anyone.
- Log out after using shared or public devices.

### 6.2 Suspicious Activity

If a customer reports suspicious account activity, such as:

- Unknown orders
- Login notifications they do not recognize
- Changes to account details they did not make

Steps:

1. Advise the customer to **change their password immediately**.
2. Confirm recent orders and changes with the customer.
3. If necessary, temporarily lock the account while investigating.
4. Escalate to the security or fraud team if the issue appears serious.

## 7. Phishing and Scam Awareness

We will **never** ask customers to:

- Share their password via email, chat, or phone.
- Provide full credit card numbers over email or chat.

If a customer receives a suspicious email or message claiming to be from us:

- Advise them **not to click any links** or download attachments.
- Ask them to:
  - Check the sender’s email address.
  - Access our website directly by typing the URL instead of using suspicious links.
- They may forward the suspicious message to our official support email for review (if allowed by policy).

## 8. Closing or Deleting an Account

- Customers can request to **close or delete** their account by contacting support.
- After verification of identity, we:
  - Deactivate the account, and
  - Remove or anonymize personal data where legally permitted and not required to be retained.
- Some information (e.g., invoices, transaction records) may need to be kept for legal, tax, or anti-fraud reasons, even after account deletion.

Agents should clearly explain:

> “We can delete or anonymize most of your personal data, but some records may need to be retained to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.”

---

## 9. Data Protection and Privacy

- We process personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
- Customers can usually:
  - Request a copy of their personal data.
  - Request correction of inaccurate data.
  - Request deletion of certain data, subject to legal requirements.

For complex privacy questions, agents should follow internal escalation procedures.
